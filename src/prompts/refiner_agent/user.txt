Subtask:
"${subtask}"

For each subtask, analyze the required resources and information to solve it:

- If the subtask can be fully completed using only the information and reasoning available to the LLM (i.e., it does not require access to real-time data, external systems, APIs, or human intervention), set 'Execution_type' to 'llm'.
- If the subtask requires information or actions that are not accessible to the LLM (such as real-world data, external APIs, databases, or manual steps), specify the appropriate 'Execution_type' (e.g., 'external_api', 'mcp', 'manual', etc.).

Be precise: Only use 'llm' if the subtask can be solved entirely by the language model without any external input or action.

Return your analysis using exactly the following format:

### ORIGINAL ###
Copy the original subtask exactly as received above.

### REFINED ###
Subtask:
Title: <short title>
Description: <description>
Expected_output: <expected output>
Subtask:
Title: <short title>
Description: <description>
Execution_type: <llm|external_api|mcp|manual|...>
Expected_output: <expected output>
Dependencies: <comma-separated titles of other refined subtasks that must be completed first, or 'None'>
... (repeat for each refined subtask, but DO NOT generate more than 6 subtasks in total)

If the subtask is already actionable, leave the '### REFINED ###' section empty.
Do not include any explanations, comments, or extra text beyond these two sections.
