Your task is to generate 3 to 7 concrete and well-defined subtasks required to successfully
fulfill the area of: '${area_name}'.

Given a main task, decompose it into subtasks.

For each subtask, analyze the required resources and information to solve it:

- If the subtask can be fully completed using only the information and reasoning available to the LLM (i.e., it does not require access to real-time data, external systems, APIs, or human intervention), set 'Execution_type' to 'llm'.
- If the subtask requires information or actions that are not accessible to the LLM (such as real-world data, external APIs, databases, or manual steps), specify the appropriate 'Execution_type' (e.g., 'external_api', 'mcp', 'manual', etc.).

Be precise: Only use 'llm' if the subtask can be solved entirely by the language model without any external input or action.

For each subtask, provide:
- Title: <short title>
- Description: <what this subtask accomplishes>
- Expected_output: <what you expect as output from this subtask>
- Dependencies: <comma-separated titles of other subtasks in this area that must be completed first, or 'None'>
- Execution_type: <llm|external_api|mcp|manual|...>

Format strictly as:
### AREA ###
${area_name}

### SUBTASKS ###
Subtask:
Title: <title>
Description: <description>
Expected_output: <expected_output>
Dependencies: <dependencies>
Subtask:
Title: <title>
Description: <description>
Expected_output: <expected_output>
Dependencies: <dependencies>
Execution_type: <execution_type>
(repeat for each subtask)

Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or extra formatting.
