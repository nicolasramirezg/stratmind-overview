If a meal is not possible, have a small snack 30-60 minutes before training, such as a banana with nut butter or a protein shake.\n3. Stay hydrated by drinking water or a sports drink to ensure optimal performance.\n\n**Post-Workout Nutrition:**\n1. Consume a combination of protein and carbohydrates within 30 minutes of finishing the workout to aid in muscle recovery and replenish glycogen stores.\n2. Opt for a protein source like whey protein, chicken, or Greek yogurt, paired with carbohydrates like rice, sweet potatoes, or fruits.\n3. Include some healthy fats to support overall recovery and nutrient absorption.\n4.
