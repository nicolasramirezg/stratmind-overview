Warm-up: Jumping jacks, arm circles, leg swings\n2. Strength: Back squats, push press\n3. Metcon: AMRAP in 12 minutes - 10 box jumps, 15 kettlebell swings\n\n**Week 1, Day 2:**\n1. Warm-up: Rowing, lunges, shoulder mobility drills\n2. Strength: Deadlifts, strict pull-ups\n3. Metcon: For time - 21-15-9 thrusters, burpees\n\n**Week 1, Day 3:**\n1. Warm-up: Jump rope, dynamic stretches\n2. Skill work: Double-unders practice\n3. Metcon: EMOM for 15 minutes - 5 handstand push-ups, 10 pistols\n\nPlease continue this format for the remaining weeks and days of the 2-month CrossFit training plan.",
        "Progression Planning": "For the progression planning of the selected CrossFit exercises, here are the guidelines:\n\n1. Progressions:\n   - Increase weight gradually for strength exercises like squats, deadlifts, and presses.\n   - Increase repetitions or sets for bodyweight exercises like pull-ups, push-ups, and burpees.\n   - Introduce more complex variations for advanced movements like handstand push-ups, muscle-ups, and pistol squats.\n   - Incorporate timed intervals or decrease rest periods to enhance conditioning for cardio-based exercises like rowing, running, and box jumps.\n\n2. Regressions:\n   - Decrease weight or use resistance bands for individuals struggling with strength exercises.\n   - Reduce repetitions or perform assisted variations for bodyweight exercises to build foundational strength.\n   - Simplify movements or use support (e.g., bands, boxes) for those finding advanced exercises challenging.\n   - Increase rest periods or modify intensity for cardio-based exercises to accommodate different fitness levels.\n\nThese guidelines will ensure that participants of varying skill levels can progress effectively and continuously improve throughout the 2-month CrossFit training plan.",

Adjust intensity and volume as needed to ensure progression over the 2-month period.",
      "Progression Strategy Development": "To establish a systematic progression strategy for the 2-month CrossFit training plan, we will implement the following approach:\n\n1. Week 1-2: Focus on establishing movement patterns and building a foundation with moderate intensity and volume.\n2. Week 3-4: Increase intensity by incorporating more complex movements and adding weight gradually to the exercises.\n3. Week 5-6: Introduce interval training and AMRAP (as many rounds as possible) workouts to boost cardiovascular endurance and overall work capacity.\n4. Week 7-8: Implement higher intensity workouts, such as EMOMs (every minute on the minute) and Tabata-style training to push boundaries and test limits.\n\nThis progression plan ensures a gradual increase in intensity, volume, and difficulty over the 2-month period, allowing for adaptation and growth while minimizing the risk of overtraining or injury.",
      "Exercise Variation Planning": "Workout Session 1:\n1. Deadlifts\n2. Pull-ups\n3. Box jumps\n4. Plank\n\nWorkout Session 2:\n1. Squats\n2. Push-ups\n3. Kettlebell swings\n4. Russian twists\n\nWorkout Session 3:\n1. Bench press\n2. Lunges\n3. Burpees\n4. Leg raises\n\nEnsure to rotate exercises and modify intensity and volume as needed throughout the 2-month training plan."

    "Exercise Selection and Progression": {
      "Exercise Selection for Workouts": "For the 2-month CrossFit training plan, here are the specific exercises tailored to each workout session:\n\n**Week 1, Day 1:**\n1. Warm-up: Jumping jacks, arm circles, leg swings\n2. Strength: Back squats, push press\n3. Metcon: AMRAP in 12 minutes - 10 box jumps, 15 kettlebell swings\n\n**Week 1, Day 2:**\n1. Warm-up: Rowing, lunges, shoulder mobility drills\n2. Strength: Deadlifts, strict pull-ups\n3. Metcon: For time - 21-15-9 thrusters, burpees\n\n**Week 1, Day 3:**\n1. Warm-up: Jump rope, dynamic stretches\n2. Skill work: Double-unders practice\n3. Metcon: EMOM for 15 minutes - 5 handstand push-ups, 10 pistols\n\nPlease continue this format for the remaining weeks and days of the 2-month CrossFit training plan.",
      "Progression Planning": "For the progression planning of the selected CrossFit exercises, here are the guidelines:\n\n1. Progressions:\n   - Increase weight gradually for strength exercises like squats, deadlifts, and presses.\n   - Increase repetitions or sets for bodyweight exercises like pull-ups, push-ups, and burpees.\n   - Introduce more complex variations for advanced movements like handstand push-ups, muscle-ups, and pistol squats.\n   - Incorporate timed intervals or decrease rest periods to enhance conditioning for cardio-based exercises like rowing, running, and box jumps.\n\n2. Regressions:\n   - Decrease weight or use resistance bands for individuals struggling with strength exercises.\n   - Reduce repetitions or perform assisted variations for bodyweight exercises to build foundational strength.\n   - Simplify movements or use support (e.g., bands, boxes) for those finding advanced exercises challenging.\n   - Increase rest periods or modify intensity for cardio-based exercises to accommodate different fitness levels.\n\nThese guidelines will ensure that participants of varying skill levels can progress effectively and continuously improve throughout the 2-month CrossFit training plan.",
      "Modification Strategies": "1. Use resistance bands for assistance in pull-ups and muscle-ups.\n2. Perform box push-ups or knee push-ups as a scaling option for regular push-ups.\n3. Use lighter dumbbells or kettlebells for scaled versions of overhead presses or snatches.\n4. Substitute double-unders with single-unders for individuals who are still mastering the skill.\n5. Incorporate step-ups on a lower box as a modification for box jumps.\n6. Perform ring rows as a scaled version of barbell rows.\n7. Use a lighter weight or perform partial range of motion for scaled versions of Olympic lifts.\n8. Incorporate wall walks as a modification for handstand push-ups.\n9. Perform lunges instead of weighted squats for individuals with mobility or strength limitations.\n10. Use a resistance band for assistance in pistol squats."

    "Recovery and Rest Days": {
      "Schedule Rest Days": "Rest days should be scheduled every 3-4 days throughout the 2-month CrossFit training plan. Here is the recommended schedule for rest days:\n\n- Week 1: Rest on Day 4 and Day 7\n- Week 2: Rest on Day 3 and Day 6\n- Week 3: Rest on Day 4 and Day 7\n- Week 4: Rest on Day 3 and Day 6\n- Week 5: Rest on Day 4 and Day 7\n- Week 6: Rest on Day 3 and Day 6\n- Week 7: Rest on Day 4 and Day 7\n- Week 8: Rest on Day 3 and Day 6\n\nThis schedule allows for adequate recovery time between intense training sessions, helping to prevent overtraining and optimize performance.",
      "Recommend Recovery Activities": "- Foam rolling: Focus on major muscle groups to release tension and improve flexibility.\n- Yoga or Pilates: Incorporate sessions to enhance mobility, core strength, and relaxation.\n- Light cardio: Engage in low-intensity activities like walking or cycling to promote blood flow and aid recovery.\n- Active recovery workout: Perform light bodyweight exercises or swimming to maintain movement without high intensity.\n- Stretching routine: Include dynamic and static stretches to improve flexibility and reduce muscle tightness."
