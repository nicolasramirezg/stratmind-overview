When dining in Bogotá, it is essential to remember to greet everyone at the table upon arrival and before leaving. Table manners are important, such as keeping your hands visible at all times and not resting your elbows on the table.\n\nIn terms of tipping customs, it is customary to leave a tip of around 10% of the total bill at restaurants. However, some higher-end establishments may include a service charge, so it's advisable to check the bill before adding an additional tip.\n\nMealtime traditions in Bogotá often involve sharing dishes family-style, so be prepared to pass plates around and engage in communal dining. Additionally, it is polite to wait for the host or the eldest person at the table to start eating before you begin your meal.\n\nOverall, respecting these dining etiquette practices will help you navigate social interactions and dining experiences in Bogotá smoothly."
