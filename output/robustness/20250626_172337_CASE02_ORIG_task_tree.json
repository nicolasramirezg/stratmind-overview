Blue-Green Deployment:\n   - Maintain two identical production environments: blue (current) and green (new).\n   - Route traffic to the green environment for testing.\n   - Once validated, switch traffic from blue to green for production.\n   - Allows quick rollback in case of issues.\n\n2. Canary Releases:\n   - Gradually roll out new features to a small subset of users.\n   - Monitor performance and user feedback.\n   - If successful, gradually increase the user base.\n   - Enables early detection of issues before full deployment.\n\n3. Rolling Updates:\n   - Update one instance of a microservice at a time.\n   - Ensure continuous availability during the update process.\n   - Incrementally deploy changes across instances.\n   - Minimize downtime and impact on users.\n\nThese deployment strategies provide flexibility, reliability, and risk mitigation when deploying microservices in the educational streaming platform."

Use URI Versioning: Include the version number in the URI path, such as \"/v1/resource\".\n2. Header Versioning: Allow clients to specify the version using custom headers like \"X-API-Version\".\n3. Content Negotiation: Support versioning through content negotiation by accepting different media types for different versions.\n4. Deprecation Policy: Clearly define a deprecation policy for old versions and communicate it to clients.\n5. Backward Compatibility: Ensure that changes are backward compatible whenever possible to minimize disruptions for existing clients.\n6. Documentation: Maintain clear and updated documentation on API versions, changes, and how to migrate between versions.\n7.
